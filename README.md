Tired of going to a configuration file to manually change the wallpaper you want and restart the session to see changes, or using/making a script that can't save the change for each display? <br><br>
Then fear not!<br><br>
HyprWallpaper is a user-made to be finished backend-tool to dynamically switch between wallpapers on the spot, by using a folder that's automatically created in the Pictures folder.<br><br>
Actually only TUI version, GUI version to be made. <br><br>
! Future module for future configuration app HyprConfig !
